# 2021

## August 2021

- [The Geneva-Percent Speedrun](/gaming/geneva-conventions-speedrun) is a write-up on a novel speedrun category completed by violating any provision of a Geneva Convention.
- Removed the resum√© showcase page entirely, as it made navigation harder, wasn't very functional, buggy, and didn't work well without JavaScript.

Technical:
- Created the site using [astro](https://astro.build) and the [unified](https://unifiedjs.com) suite for Markdown processing.
- Added dark mode.
- Added syntax highlighting for code blocks using [Prism](https://prismjs.com).
- Added a navigation sidebar to the reader.
- Added a list of tags to the posts' headers.

## July 2021

- Decided to remake my personal website.
- Designed the first version of [the showcase page](/) in [Figma](https://figma.com) and made decisions on the reader design.
