Pascal's wager is a famous philosophical argument
to the effect that rational agents should act as though God exists.

The argument goes, more or less, as follows:

- Either God exists, or He doesn't.
- If God does not exist and I believe in God and act as though He exists,
  I incur some finite cost compared to correctly believing He does not exist.
- But, if God does exist and I incorrectly believe He does not,
  I stand to incur an _infinite_ cost compared to
  an _infinite_ reward if I correctly believe in God
  (an eternity in Hell compared to an eternity in Heaven).
- Therefore,
  as long as I don't assign a probability of literally zero to God's existence,
  I should act as though God does exist and try to believe it.

In the form of a payoff matrix (where $c$ is some positive number):

|           | God Exists | God Does Not Exist |
|-----------|------------|--------------------|
| Belief    | $+\infin$  | $-c$               |
| No Belief | $-\infin$  | $+c$               |

Some people use this argument as though it proves the existence of God,
rather than just a person's interest in believing in God,
which is, of course, ridiculous.

Even the limited conclusion of Pascal's wager is wrong, though.
The problem lies in the construction of the above payoff matrix:
The two columns are "God Exists" and "God Does Not Exist",
not "God Exists" and "Your Belief in God is Inconsequential."

This is a classic example of a false dilemma.
Simply selecting the hypothesis that God exists from the space of all possible hypotheses misses the myriad other hypotheses which completely invalidate the wager's conclusions.

For any wager like Pascal's,
there is also an "anti-wager:"
In the case of God,
consider the existence of an "anti-God" who sends you to hell if you believe in God and heaven if you do not.
Then, the incentives are apparently reversed,
and rational agents should behave as though God does not exist, on pain of infinite disutility.
