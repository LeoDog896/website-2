In this document, I'll be proposing a novel new speedrun category, the "Geneva%." The Geneva% speedrun is completed by violating the provisions of the Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols to the greatest extent possible.

# Provisions for Completion

In order for completion to be possible in games which do not portray the Geneva Conventions and its parties in-game, some provisions must be made. In most games, these will include:

1. Articles which cannot be violated are not considered.
2. The in-game representation of the player is treated as a High Contracting Party to the Conventions.
3. Other in-game entities may be treated as parties to the convention.
4. Actions which are violations due to more than one article, but not those articles in isolation, are said to violate all of those articles.

These provisions are inherently dependent on the nature of the game being ran, and as such they should be decided on a per-game basis.

# Commentary

Following are comments on each article of each convention. These commentaries are designed to help moderators decide upon [Provisions for Completion](#provisions-for-completion) and players to route their runs.

## Convention of 1949

The Geneva Convention of 1949, entitled the "Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field," provides (unsurprisingly) for those who fall ill or are wounded on the battlefield, as well as the medical infrastructure supporting them.

### Chapter 1

#### Article 1 - Respect for the Convention

> The High Contracting Parties undertake to respect and to ensure respect for the present Convention in all circumstances.

This can be achieved by merely violating another article of this Convention.

#### Article 2 - Application of the Convention

> In addition to the provisions which shall be implemented in peacetime, the present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them. 
>
> The Convention shall also apply to all cases of partial or total occupation of the territory of a High Contracting Party, even if the said occupation meets with no armed resistance.
>
> Although one of the Powers in conflict may not be a party to the present Convention, the Powers who are parties thereto shall remain bound by it in their mutual relations. They shall furthermore be bound by the Convention in relation to the said Power, if the latter accepts and applies the provisions thereof. 

This widens the scope the Convention's provisions, which at first glance appears to be a good thing, but in reality presents our first problem:[^1] if a Convention is violated under the jurisdiction established by Article 2, which article is violated?

This is reason for Provision for Completion #3.

[^1]: Technically it could be said that this problem also applies with Article 1, but it's less noticable.

#### Article 3 - Conflicts not of an International Character

> In the case of armed conflict not of an international character occurring in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties, each Party to the conflict shall be bound to apply, as a minimum, the following provisions:  
> 1. Persons taking no active part in the hostilities, including members of armed forces who have laid down their arms and those placed hors de combat by sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause, shall in all circumstances be treated humanely, without any adverse distinction founded on race, colour, religion or faith, sex, birth or wealth, or any other similar criteria.  
> 
>     To this end, the following acts are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever with respect to the above-mentioned persons:  
>     1. Violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture;  
>     2. Taking of hostages;  
>     3. Outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment;  
>     4. The passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court, affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.  
> 2. The wounded and sick shall be collected and cared for.  
> 
> An impartial humanitarian body, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, may offer its services to the Parties to the conflict.  
>
> The Parties to the conflict should further endeavour to bring into force, by means of special agreements, all or part of the other provisions of the present Convention.  
>
> The application of the preceding provisions shall not affect the legal status of the Parties to the conflict.

In short, a runner should
1. Fight in a war.
2. Wait for an enemy soldier to surrender or be otherwise incapacitated.
3. Take them hostage.
4. Humiliate them.
5. Wound them if necessary.
7. Don't care for their wounds.
5. Charge them using a military court.
6. Murder or torture them.
8. ???
9. Profit.

#### Article 4 - Application by Neutral Powers

> Neutral Powers shall apply by analogy the provisions of the present Convention to the wounded and sick, and to members of the medical personnel and to chaplains of the armed forces of the Parties to the conflict, received or interned in their territory, as well as to dead persons found.

This will be difficult or impossible in most games, as there is often no Neutral Party to speak of. Even when there is, if they follow the conventions there may nothing that can be done about it, since forcing them to break the Conventions almost certainly nullfies their neutrality.

#### Article 5 - Duration of Application

> For the protected persons who have fallen into the hands of the enemy, the present Convention shall apply until their final repatriation.

Like Articles 1, 2, and 4 before it, this article serves merely to widen the scope of the Convention.

#### Article 6 - Special Agreements

> In addition to the agreements expressly provided for in Articles 10, 15, 23, 28, 31, 36, 37 and 52, the High Contracting Parties may conclude other special agreements for all matters concerning which they may deem it suitable to make separate provision. No special agreement shall adversely affect the situation of the wounded and sick, of members of the medical personnel or of chaplains, as defined by the present Convention, nor restrict the rights which it confers upon them.
>
> Wounded and sick, as well as medical personnel and chaplains, shall continue to have the benefit of such agreements as long as the Convention is applicable to them, except where express provisions to the contrary are contained in the aforesaid or in subsequent agreements, or where more favourable measures have been taken with regard to them by one or other of the Parties to the conflict.

To violate this Article, a runner should make an agreement with another party which causes a violation of the Convention.

#### Article 7 - Non-Renunciation of Rights

> Wounded and sick, as well as members of the medical personnel and chaplains, may in no circumstances renounce in part or in entirety the rights secured to them by the present Convention, and by the special agreements referred to in the foregoing Article, if such there be.

It's arguable whether this Article is even *possible* to break, since the rights it ensures cannot be renounced are provided by the Convention itself; if it can be broken a runner could do so by simply renouncing the rights provided to them under the Convention.

#### Article 8 - Protecting Powers

> The present Convention shall be applied with the cooperation and under the scrutiny of the Protecting Powers whose duty it is to safeguard the interests of the Parties to the conflict. For this purpose, the Protecting Powers may appoint, apart from their diplomatic or consular staff, delegates from amongst their own nationals or the nationals of other neutral Powers. The said delegates shall be subject to the approval of the Power with which they are to carry out their duties.
> 
> The Parties to the conflict shall facilitate, to the greatest extent possible, the task of the representatives or delegates of the Protecting Powers.
> 
> The representatives or delegates of the Protecting Powers shall not in any case exceed their mission under the present Convention. They shall, in particular, take account of the imperative necessities of security of the State wherein they carry out their duties. Their activities shall only be restricted as an exceptional and temporary measure when this is rendered necessary by imperative military necessities.

A runner must do two things:

- Become a [Protecting Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protecting_power) and appoint a delegate for the purposes of Protection without the approval of the Protected Power.
- As a Party to a Conflict, fail to facilitate the tasks of the delegates to themselves of a Protecting Party.

#### Article 9 - Activites of the International Committee of the Red Cross

> The provisions of the present Convention constitute no obstacle to the humanitarian activities which the International Committee of the Red Cross or any other impartial humanitarian organization may, subject to the consent of the Parties to the conflict concerned, undertake for the protection of wounded and sick, medical personnel and chaplains, and for their relief.

The [International Committee of the Red Cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Committee_of_the_Red_Cross), or a similar humanitarian organization must administer aid without the consent of the an aided Party.

#### Article 10 - Substitutes for Protecting Powers

> The High Contracting Parties may at any time agree to entrust to an organization which offers all guarantees of impartiality and efficacy the duties incumbent on the Protecting Powers by virtue of the present Convention.
>
> When wounded and sick, or medical personnel and chaplains do not benefit or cease to benefit, no matter for what reason, by the activities of a Protecting Power or of an organization provided for in the first paragraph above, the Detaining Power shall request a neutral State, or such an organization, to undertake the functions performed under the present Convention by a Protecting Power designated by the Parties to a conflict.
>
> If protection cannot be arranged accordingly, the Detaining Power shall request or shall accept, subject to the provisions of this Article, the offer of the services of a humanitarian organization, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, to assume the humanitarian functions performed by Protecting Powers under the present Convention.
>
> Any neutral Power, or any organization invited by the Power concerned or offering itself for these purposes, shall be required to act with a sense of responsibility towards the Party to the conflict on which persons protected by the present Convention depend, and shall be required to furnish sufficient assurances that it is in a position to undertake the appropriate functions and to discharge them impartially.
>
> No derogation from the preceding provisions shall be made by special agreements between Powers one of which is restricted, even temporarily, in its freedom to negotiate with the other Power or its allies by reason of military events, more particularly where the whole, or a substantial part, of the territory of the said Power is occupied.
>
> Whenever in the present Convention mention is made of a Protecting Power, such mention also applies to substitute organizations in the sense of the present Article.

There are multiple ways to violate this Article, but the simplest is for the runner to form an agreement with a Power with which they are at war which derogates the other provisions of the Article. For example, a treaty stipulating that a Protecting Power not be substituted under any circumstances.

#### Article 11 - Conciliation Procedure

> In cases where they deem it advisable in the interest of protected persons, particularly in cases of disagreement between the Parties to the conflict as to the application or interpretation of the provisions of the present Convention, the Protecting Powers shall lend their good offices with a view to settling the disagreement.
>
> For this purpose, each of the Protecting Powers may, either at the invitation of one Party or on its own initiative, propose to the Parties to the conflict a meeting of their representatives, in particular of the authorities responsible for the wounded and sick, members of medical personnel and chaplains, possibly on neutral territory suitably chosen. The Parties to the conflict shall be bound to give effect to the proposals made to them for this purpose. The Protecting Powers may, if necessary, propose for approval by the Parties to the conflict, a person belonging to a neutral Power or delegated by the International Committee of the Red Cross, who shall be invited to take part in such a meeting

A runner must refuse to meet another Power after a Protecting Party proposes a meeting with that Power.
