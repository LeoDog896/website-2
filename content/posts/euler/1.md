The first [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problem reads as follows:

> If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
>
> Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

## Trivial Solution

The simplest solution is to just iterate over all numbers from 0 to 1000, check if they are multiples of 3 or 5, and sum those that are.

```rs
let sum = 0;
for i in 0..1000 {
    if i % 3 == 0 || i % 5 == 0 {
        sum += i;
    }
}
```

or in a more functional style:

```rs
let sum = (0..1000).filter(|i| i % 3 == 0 || i % 5 == 0).sum();
```

This has a runtime complexity of $O(n)$, where $n$ is the upper bound of the range. More than fast enough for small $n$ like 1000, but we can do better.

## Constant-Time Solution

The crucial insight which allows us to solve the problem in constant time is the fact that the sum is equal to the sum of the multiples of 3 plus the sum of the multiples of 5 _minus_ the sum of multiples of both (i.e. multiples of 15).

We can then use the formula for the sum of the first $n$ natural numbers, $\frac{n^2 - n}{2}$, to find the sum of all multiples of a number $m$ less than $n$:

$$
m \frac{{\lfloor \frac{n-1}{m} \rfloor}^2 - {\lfloor \frac{n-1}{m} \rfloor}}{2}
$$

Now we simply substitute the numbers given by the problem:

$$
3 \frac{333^2 - 333}{2}
+ 5 \frac{199^2 - 199}{2}
- 15 \frac{66^2 - 66}{2}
$$

This gives us our final answer of $233168$ without the need for a single line of code. If you were really dedicated, you could even calculate this on paper!
