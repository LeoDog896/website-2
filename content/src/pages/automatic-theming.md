title: "Automatic Theming"
description: "Software themes are an important part of any system, but traditionally a lot of work is necessary to theme a system consistently, especially with the increasing prevalence of webapps; to make it worse yet, this work must be repeated every time one desires a new aesthetic. Automatic theming tools are still young, but with some initial effort, they can enable theme switching over an entire system in seconds."

There is a fundamental lack of consistency in the aesthetics of software. With a few exceptions, each and every application uses its own themes because there is no standard. The best we can hope for is vaguely similar dark and light themes.

Fortunately, with great effort, it is possible to achieve a relatively high degree of consistency. It may not be possible to theme every single website you will ever visit, but you can theme your terminal, your desktop environment, your browser, your text editor, and far more. Many (including myself), have spent hours upon hours manually theming their systems.

This is not ideal; it takes a huge time commitment to do something like this. The worst part, in my opinion, is that once you've done this, you have to do it _again_ if you want to change up the look of your system.

Of course, the obvious solution is just automate it, that is create a tool which accepts themes in a common format, adapts them to various applications, and applies the adapted themes to them; however, this is easier said than done. In order for a solution to be adopted, it must be able to theme a significant subset of its users' applications, and in order to do that, there must be users to contribute support for their applications.

For this reason, automatic theming has a very high barrier of entry. The only people who can achieve it are those with the skills to roll support for their applications themselves. Combined with the large time commitment and the fact that the benefits of even a completely consistent solution are small (primarily reduced context-switching).

## Pywal

By far the most-used automatic theming tool is [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal). It was created by Dylan Araps of Neofetch fame. Pywal's basic function is to extract a color palette from an image. After it extracts the palette, it sets open terminal colors with it and renders user-defined templates.

With a little work, this can be used to automatically theme almost all applications. When I was still using pywal, I wrote [a wrapper script](https://github.com/max-niederman/dots/blob/ad1bc832bcdc462f52c5abeff1cba0929d9691ae/fish/functions/walu.fish) which ran all the executables in [a directory](https://github.com/max-niederman/dots/tree/ad1bc832bcdc462f52c5abeff1cba0929d9691ae/wal/update.d). These executables would then use the rendered templates to apply themes to various apps which needed to be reloaded (or didn't support symlinked theme files).

Pywal is very simple, and because of this simplicity, it is quite easy to use. However, it is, first and foremost, a _palette extraction_ tool, not a theming automation tool. This is apparent in its monolithic architecture: its palette extraction function cannot easily be decoupled from its theme application function, which is not even customizable.

A lacking theme application function is not _necessarily_ a problem. For instance, as the UNIX philosophy dictates, we could use pywal only for palette extraction and another tool for theme application. This is, more or less, what I did myself when I was using pywal. Unfortunately no such tool currently exists, and even if it did that solution would only _raise_ the barrier of entry.

### Limitations

None of the preceding problems are, in my opinion, reason enough to abandon pywal and use a different tool for palette extraction. What I do believe warrants this is the simple fact that pywal extracts ugly themes.

Pywal's palette extraction works by a backend-frontend architecture. You can select from multiple backends. As of writing this, _all_ of pywal's backends use a [k-means clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) algorithim to extract colors from an image.

K-means clustering is well suited for extracting one or two accents for use in a UI, but for most images it will produce bad _system_ colorschemes. This is primarily becuase k-means clustering can only extract colors which are actually in the image[^1].

[^1]: This is technically not true. Lloyd's algorithm can also extract the centroid of colors in the image, but it would be highly unusual for a color which isn't very near to one in the image to be found.

It is for this reason that pywal only uses a list of accents without an arguably more useful named color palette (red, green, blue, etc.). You want a dangerous action to be colored red? Well, sorry, you can't; it's "accent #3" or nothing.

Even worse, the accents are often very similar colors which reduces contrast thereby making reading harder. This is only a big problem in images which are mostly one color, and it could probably be greatly improved by processing the colors for better contrast after the clustering step.

Because pywal is primarily focused on extracting colors from images, this limitation will always plague it, severely limiting its uses.

## Luthien

Frustrated with the limitations of pywal, I decided to write my own tool with the following goals in mind:

- Theme extraction should be modular and support at least image extraction and manual theme creation.
- Theme application should be easily pluggable **at runtime**. These plugins should be language-agnostic and as easy as possible to write.
- The theme format should include a named color palette, accents, a wallpaper, and be easily extensible.

Luthien is not yet finished, but I hope that in the future it will make theme automation worth the effort for more people.

### Extraction from Images

Luthien's image extractor is different from all other tools I know of. Instead of a k-means-based algorithm, it uses a far simpler algorithm which simply finds the centroid, i.e. the multi-dimensional arithmetic mean, of all of the image's pixels in user-defined color ranges in the [CIE L\*a\*b\* color space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELAB_color_space).

As of writing, if an image contains no pixels inside a target range, the center of the range is used. In the future, I plan to enable users to set a default or set it to algorithmically guess at a complementing color.

### Plugins

Luthien's plugin interface is very simple. First, the input is serialized to JSON and passed to the plugin process through the standard input. Then the plugin executes using this data and returns a response code indicative of its success. The standard error is also inherited from the parent process for logging.

A Rust library for writing complex plugins is provided, as well as some first-party plugins which will cover most users' needs:

- `luthien-terminal` generates terminal control sequences, sends them to open pseudoterminals, and saves them to a file to be read when new terminal are opened.
- `luthien-templates` renders Jinja2-like templates with theme data.
- `luthien-sass` exposes theme data to Sass modules and compiles them to CSS.

## Future Improvements

The difficulty of installation and initial configuration must be reduced. As of writing, from-scratch configuration of a theming setup similar to my own could easily take >4 hours. The vast majority of this time is spent manually integrating with applications.

Ideally, there would be a package manager-like tool to bootstrap integrations with minimal effort on the user's part. Unfortunately, such tooling would be quite difficult to create, especially for more complex integrations which can interfere with static configurations. Such a tool could also be used as a public theme repository, making it much easier to find and download themes.
