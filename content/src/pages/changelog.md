## 2021

### September 2021

Technical:

- Split the site into seperate NPM packages for the theme and content.
- Added epigraph styling.

### August 2021

- Removed the resumé showcase page entirely, as it made navigation harder, wasn't very functional, buggy, and didn't work well without JavaScript.
- [The Geneva-Percent Speedrun](/gaming/geneva-conventions-speedrun) is a write-up on a novel speedrun category completed by violating any provision of a Geneva Convention.
- [ttyper: a Terminal-Based Typing Test](/projects/ttyper) and [Netlify vs. Vercel: A Comparison](/netlify-vs-vercel) are articles I ported over from my old site and slightly modified.
- [Automatic Theming](/automatic-theming) is about the state of automatic system theming.

Technical:

- Created the site using [astro](https://astro.build) and the [unified](https://unifiedjs.com) suite for Markdown processing.
- Added dark mode.
- Added syntax highlighting for code blocks using [Prism](https://prismjs.com).
- Added a navigation sidebar to the reader.
- Added a list of tags to the posts' headers.
- Added the page's description to its header.

### July 2021

- Decided to remake my personal website.
- Designed the first version of the "resumé" page in [Figma](https://figma.com) and made decisions on the reader design.
